Breaking it down, you should:

- Use PhotosPicker to let users import a photo from their photo library.
- Detect when a new photo is imported, and immediately ask the user to name the photo.
- Save that name and photo somewhere safe.
- Show all names and photos in a list, sorted by name.
-Create a detail screen that shows a picture full size.
- Decide on a way to save all this data.
- show a map with a pin that marks where they were when that picture was added
